## 2.20.0

June 16, 2025

### Upgrade Paths {#2-20-0-upgrade-paths}

NGINX Instance Manager 2.20.0 supports upgrades from these previous versions:

- 2.17.0 - 2.19.2

If your NGINX Instance Manager version is older, you may need to upgrade to an intermediate version before upgrading to the target version.

### What's New{#2-20-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Added support to report on multiple NGINX One subscriptions using a single instance of NGINX Instance Manager**

   Customers can have multiple NGINX One subscriptions or licenses with different attributes (prod, nonprod, etc.). Now a single NGINX Instance Manager can receive usage from these instances and send a bulk usage report to F5.

  We also simplified the licensing process for disconnected use cases. When running NGINX Instance Manager in disconnected mode, all features are enabled for 90 days when a JWT is uploaded. Customers have these 90 days to send the first usage report to activate the NGINX Instance Manager license.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Introducing lightweight mode**

   NGINX Instance Manager can now run in lightweight mode without the ClickHouse database dependency. This mode requires fewer resources and is perfect for customers who don't need metrics-related functionality. It supports basic use cases such as:

  - Fleet management
  - WAF configuration
  - Usage tracking
  - Certificate management
  - Template automation

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Improved web analytics sent to F5**

   NGINX Instance Manager now sends improved web analytics to F5. This helps F5 understand common use cases of NGINX Instance Manager and improve functionality.


### Changes in Default Behavior{#2-20-0-changes-in-behavior}
This release has the following changes in default behavior:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Breadcrumbs added for Overview, Manage, and Config templates**

  We have added breadcrumb navigation links for the "Overview", "Manage", and "Config" templates in the NGINX Instance Manager user interface.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Export instance groups to Excel**

  You can now export instance groups to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet from the Instance Group section.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Export all instances functionality added**

  NGINX Instance Manager's export function only included currently visible instances, not the full list. Customers had to run separate exports and merge data manually.

  An `Export All` button is now available under the Instances section. Clicking it downloads all instance details in a single Excel file.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Automatic feature enablement in disconnected instances on license upload**


  NGINX Instance Manager now enables all features by default when you upload a license to a disconnected instance. This update ensures customers can begin using the full capabilities of the system without additional configuration.

  Customers have a 90-day window to complete the full license process. If they don't complete it within this period, the instance is automatically deactivated.

## 2.19.0

February 06, 2025

### Upgrade Paths {#2-19-0-upgrade-paths}

NGINX Instance Manager 2.19.0 supports upgrades from these previous versions:

- 2.16.0 - 2.18.0

If your NGINX Instance Manager version is older, you may need to upgrade to an intermediate version before upgrading to the target version.

### Important Note about upgrades to NGINX Instance Manager 2.19 for API Connectivity Manager (ACM) users {#2-19-0-pre-Important-Note-about-upgrades-to-NGINX-Instance-Manager-2-19-for-API-Connectivity-Manager-(ACM)-users}

NGINX Instance Manager 2.19 is the first iteration of NGINX Instance Manager as a standalone product without modules such as API Connectivity Manager (which is [EoS](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137989)). NGINX Instance Manager now includes Security Monitoring (previously a module) as a feature under App Protect in the web interface. The Instance Manager helm charts and docker compose options include Security Monitoring also.

Instance Manager 2.19 will not be compatible or supported with EoS API Connectivity Manager. API Connectivity Manager users get support of Instance Manager up to 2.18 and upgrades to Instance Manager 2.19 will not succeed if API Connectivity Manager is installed.

### What's New{#2-19-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINX Instance Manager is now a standalone product**

   Starting with this release, NGINX Instance Manager is a standalone product without any dependencies from other NGINX products (NGINX Management Suite, API Connectivity Manager).

  The Security Monitoring module is now a feature of NGINX Instance Manager found in the "App Protect" section.

  If NGINX API Connectivity Manager is currently running as a module in NGINX Instance Manager or NGINX Management Suite in your environment, you will need to remove the module before upgrading to 2.19.0.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Forward proxy support using the HTTP CONNECT method**

   NGINX Instance Manager can now be configured to use the CONNECT HTTP method to request that a proxy establish a HTTP(S) tunnel to an outbound server. This covers all use-cases that require outbound access such as App Protect Signature updates, licensing and usage reporting.

  - Documentation: [Configure NGINX Instance Manager to use a forward proxy]({{< ref "nim/system-configuration/configure-forward-proxy.md" >}})

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Support for OpenShift Deployments using Helm**

   Added an `OpenShift` flag to the Helm charts that creates a security context constraint resource to support NGINX Instance Manager in OpenShift.

  - Documentation: [Deploy NGINX Instance Manager using Helm]({{< ref "nim/deploy/kubernetes/deploy-using-helm.md" >}})

- {{% icon-feature %}} **VM-based active-passive HA Support with keepalived**

   This release includes documentation for a basic HA (High availability) setup with two nodes, for bare metal and VM based environments. This feature uses keepalived and a failover script if a primary NGINX Instance Manager node fails.

  - Documentation: [Configure high availability (HA) for NGINX Instance Manager]({{< ref "nim/system-configuration/configure-high-availability.md" >}})

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Added "Export" feature  for templates**

   We have added a new option to export templates using the NGINX Instance Manager web interface.


### Changes in Default Behavior{#2-19-0-changes-in-behavior}
This release has the following changes in default behavior:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Prompt to specify an FQDN for NIM when generating SSL certificates during installation**

  When installing, users will be prompted to enter a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to include in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) of the NGINX Instance Manager's self-signed certificate generated during installation. This FQDN can serve as the server name for NGINX Instance Manager. Users can also specify this FQDN in the Installation Script

  {{< note >}}Starting with NGINX Plus R33, usage data reporting requires validating the SSL certificate of NGINX Instance Manager via the `ssl_verify` directive in the `mgmt` block. Proper SAN configuration ensures seamless SSL verification.{{< /note >}}

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Watchdog enhancements to improve stability**

  We have introduced new configurable element in `nms.conf` called `enable_watchdog_notifications`. When enabled, if any process takes longer than expected to respond the customer will get a notification in the web interface warning about the unresponsive process. Previously, a Watchdog process was stopping the process and led to configurations not applying.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Expired unmanaged certificates are eventually removed from the web interface**

  Starting in 2.19.0, remote certificates that are expired are removed from the web interface after 30 days.


### Resolved Issues{#2-19-0-resolved-issues}

## 2.18.0

November 08, 2024

### Upgrade Paths {#2-18-0-upgrade-paths}

NGINX Instance Manager 2.18.0 supports upgrades from these previous versions:

- 2.15.0 - 2.17.4

If your NGINX Instance Manager version is older, you may need to upgrade to an intermediate version before upgrading to the target version.

### What's New{#2-18-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Resilient Docker Compose NGINX Instance Manager deployment**

   In 2.17, we released a [bundled container image]({{< ref "nim/deploy/docker/deploy-nginx-instance-manager-docker-compose.md" >}}) with all NGINX Instance Manager components. While this is a great option for demos and lab environments, it is not the most fault-tolerant for production.

  This [Docker Compose option]({{< ref "nim/deploy/docker/deploy-nginx-instance-manager-docker-compose.md" >}}) unlocks another easy, production-ready installation method for customers using Docker. It will also make upgrades easier when new Docker images are released by F5 NGINX. This option includes health checking, NGINX App Protect compilation support, and security monitoring.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Entitlement and visibility for NGINX Plus R33 – Telemetry reporting for disconnected environments**

   If NGINX Instance Manager has internet access, customers can [automatically or manually send the usage data to F5]({{< ref "nim/admin-guide/report-usage-connected-deployment.md" >}}) as part of the new NGINX Plus R33 changes.

  For customers who have NGINX Instance Manager deployed in [disconnected environments]({{< ref "nim/disconnected" >}}), this release also includes support for manual usage reporting. Customers can now manually license NGINX Instance Manager and export usage telemetry for fully disconnected environments. For usage reporting, customers can:

  - **Export the usage report**: Manually export the usage report from NGINX Instance Manager.
  - **Send the report to F5**: Submit the report to F5 for verification from a location with internet access.
  - **Upload the acknowledgment**: After verification, upload the acknowledgment from F5 to NGINX Instance Manager.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Ridiculously easy NGINX Instance Manager installation script (Bash)**

   Reduce the number of steps to deploy all NGINX Instance Manager components, including prerequisites, using a single [installation script]({{< ref "nim/deploy/vm-bare-metal/install.md" >}}). The script supports every OS that NGINX Instance Manager supports in the [technical specifications]({{< ref "nim/fundamentals/tech-specs.md" >}}).

  The script installs NGINX (Plus or Open Source), ClickHouse, and NGINX Instance Manager. Customers only need their NGINX Plus certificate, key, and, for NGINX Plus R33 or later, a JWT downloaded from MyF5. Support for offline installations will be added in a future update.

  Support for [offline installations]({{< ref "nim/disconnected/offline-install-guide.md" >}}) is also available for air-gapped environments.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Adds support for NGINX App Protect WAF v5.3 and v4.11**

     NGINX Instance Manager 2.18.0 adds support for [NGINX App Protect WAF v5.3 and v4.11]({{< relref "nap-waf/v5/admin-guide/overview.md" >}}).

    NGINX App Protect WAF v5, designed for both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus environments, includes a dynamic NGINX module and containerized WAF services. It provides robust security and scalability.


### Changes in Default Behavior{#2-18-0-changes-in-behavior}
This release has the following changes in default behavior:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **The NGINX Usage page now only shows instances configured with the NGINX Plus R33 mgmt block.**

  The "NGINX Usage" page previously displayed instances connected to NGINX Instance Manager through multiple methods, including the NGINX Agent, health checks, and the `mgmt` block in NGINX Plus R31-R32. With the introduction of native reporting in NGINX Plus R33, only instances using this feature appear on the page, preventing duplicates. For more information on R33 usage reporting, see [About subscription licenses]({{< ref "solutions/about-subscription-licenses.md" >}}).


### Resolved Issues{#2-18-0-resolved-issues}

### Upgrade Paths {#2-17-0-upgrade-paths}

NGINX Instance Manager 2.17.0 supports upgrades from these previous versions:

- 2.14.0 - 2.16.0

If your NGINX Instance Manager version is older, you may need to upgrade to an intermediate version before upgrading to the target version.

### What's New{#2-17-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Adds support for NGINX App Protect WAF v5**

   NGINX Instance Manager 2.17.0 adds support for [NGINX App Protect WAF v5.](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect-waf/v5/admin-guide/overview/).

  NGINX App Protect WAF v5 (designed for both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus environments) consists of a dynamic NGINX module and containerized WAF services, providing robust security and scalability.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Hosted Docker images for Kubernetes Helm charts**

   Prior to this release, users had to download NGINX Instance Manager docker images and push them to their local container registry for use in the Kubernetes Helm charts. This was not very turnkey and required multiple steps before being able to use the Helm charts. Now all Instance Manager container images are available from F5's public docker repository, simplifying the installation in Kubernetes.

  See the [Deploy Instance Manager on Kubernetes]({{< ref "/nim/deploy/kubernetes/deploy-using-helm.md" >}}) documentation for more information.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Ansible role to deploy NGINX Instance Manager**

   This release comes with an Ansible role to help you Install NGINX Instance Manager quickly, while also encouraging the best practices for your chosen environment.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINX Instance Manager IaC using Packer and Terraform**

   This release improves the [Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project]({{< ref "/nim/deploy/infrastructure-as-code/overview.md#nginx-management-suite-infrastructure-as-code" >}}) to help you quickly get started with NGINX Instance Manager using Packer and Terraform.

  The project uses Packer to create images and Terraform to deploy these images to your preferred cloud provider, including GCP, Azure, or vSphere.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Single docker image with all the NGINX Instance Manager services and dependencies**

   This release includes access to a single Docker image for running NGINX Instance Manager as a container. This allows customers to deploy Instance Manager locally with a single "docker run" command. For more details, see [Deploy NGINX Instance Manager in a Single Docker Container]({{< ref "/nim/deploy/docker/deploy-nginx-instance-manager-docker-compose.md" >}}).


### Changes in Default Behavior{#2-17-0-changes-in-behavior}
This release has the following changes in default behavior:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Web Analytics**

  NGINX Instance Manager now collects and sends anonymized telemetry and interaction information for analysis by F5 NGINX. This information is used to improve our products and services.

  Customers have the option to opt out of data collection by disabling the feature in the Instance Manager web interface, using the Account menu in the top-right corner of the screen. For more details, see [Configure Telemetry and Web Analytics]({{< ref "/nim/system-configuration/configure-telemetry.md" >}}).

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Augment Template order now matches NGINX configuration structure**

  When you generate a configuration using augment templates, the order shown in the UI now matches the structure of an NGINX configuration. This makes filling out a template more intuitive.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **End of support for CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**

  CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [end of maintenance support](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/rhel-7-end-of-maintenance) on June 30, 2024.

  Since these operating systems won't get any more updates or security patches, NGINX Instance Manager no longer supports them.

  Please upgrade your environment to one of the [supported distributions]({{< ref "/nim/fundamentals/tech-specs.md#supported-distributions" >}}) to continue using NGINX Instance Manager.

## 2.16.0

April 18, 2024

### Upgrade Paths {#2-16-0-upgrade-paths}

NGINX Instance Manager 2.16.0 supports upgrades from these previous versions:

- 2.13.0 - 2.15.1

If your NGINX Instance Manager version is older, you may need to upgrade to an intermediate version before upgrading to the target version.

### What's New{#2-16-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Introducing configuration templates for simplifying NGINX configurations and self-service workflows**

   This release of NGINX Instance Manager introduces [Config Templates]({{< ref "nim/nginx-configs/config-templates/concepts/config-templates.md" >}}). These templates use Go templating to make it easier to set up and standardize NGINX configurations. Now, you don't need to know all the details of NGINX syntax to create a working configuration. Just provide the required inputs for a template, and the system will do the rest. This makes setting up NGINX simpler and helps you follow best practices.

  To provide more control over your configurations, [augment templates]({{< ref "nim/nginx-configs/config-templates/concepts/default-base-template.md#augmenting-global-default-base-template" >}}) let you modify only specific segments of your NGINX configuration. This, when combined with [RBAC for template submissions]({{< ref "/nim/nginx-configs/config-templates/how-to/rbac-config-templates-and-submissions.md" >}}), enables self-service workflows. Look for pre-built templates for common scenarios in our GitHub repositories soon.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Stability and performance improvements**

   This release enhances system stability and performance.


### Changes in Default Behavior{#2-16-0-changes-in-behavior}

### Security Updates{#2-9-0-security-updates}

{{< important >}}
For the protection of our customers, NGINX doesn't disclose security issues until an investigation has occurred and a fix is available.
{{< /important >}}

This release includes the following security updates:

- {{% icon-resolved %}} **Instance Manager vulnerability CVE-2023-1550**

  NGINX Agent inserts sensitive information into a log file ([CVE-2023-1550](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1550)). An authenticated attacker with local access to read NGINX Agent log files may gain access to private keys. This issue is exposed only when the non-default trace-level logging is enabled.

  NGINX Agent is included with NGINX Instance Manager, and used in conjunction with API Connectivity Manager and the Security Monitoring module.

  This issue has been classified as [CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html).

  #### Mitigation

  - Avoid configuring trace-level logging in the NGINX Agent configuration file. For more information, refer to the [Configuring the NGINX Agent]({{< ref "/nms/nginx-agent/install-nginx-agent.md#configuring-the-nginx-agent ">}}) section of NGINX Management Suite documentation. If trace-level logging is required, ensure only trusted users have access to the log files.

  #### Fixed in

  - NGINX Agent 2.23.3
  - Instance Manager 2.9.0

  For more information, refer to the MyF5 article [K000133135](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000133135).


### Changes in Default Behavior{#2-9-0-changes-in-behavior}
This release has the following changes in default behavior:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **SSL Certificates can be associated with Instance Groups**

  When assigning SSL certificates for the NGINX data plane, you have the option of associating them with a single instance or with an instance group. When associated with an instance group, the certificates will be shared across all instances in the group.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **⚠ Action required: OIDC configurations for the management plane must be updated after upgrading to Instance Manager 2.9.0**

  OIDC configuration files were modified to improve support for automation and integration in CI/CD pipelines. To continue using OIDC after upgrading to Instance Manager 2.9.0, you'll need to update these configuration files.

  To take advantage of the expanded functionality for OIDC authentication with NGINX Management Suite, we recommend following these two options:

  #### Option 1

  1. During the upgrade, type `Y` when prompted to respond `Y or I: install the package mainatiner's version` for each of the following files:

      - `/etc/nms/nginx/oidc/openid_configuration.conf`
      - `/etc/nms/nginx/oidc/openid_connect.conf`
      - `/etc/nms/nginx/oidc/openid_connect.js`

  1. After the upgrade finishes, make the following changes to the `/etc/nms/nginx/oidc/openid_configuration.conf` file using the `/etc/nms/oidc/openid_connect.conf.dpkg-old` that was created as a backup:

      - Uncomment the appropriate "Enable when using OIDC with" for your IDP (for example, keycloak, azure).
      - Update `$oidc_authz_endpoint` value with the corresponding values from `openid_connect.conf.dpkg-old`.
      - Update `$oidc_token_endpoint` value with the corresponding values from `openid_connect.conf.dpkg-old`.
      - Update `$oidc_jwt_keyfile` value with the corresponding values from `openid_connect.conf.dpkg-old`.
      - Update `$oidc_client` and `oidc_client_secret` with corresponding values from `openid_connect.conf.dpkg-old`.
      - Review and restore any other customizations from `openid_connect.conf.dpkg-old` beyond those mentioned above.

  1. Save the file.
  1. Restart NGINX Management Suite:

      ```bash

## 2.8.0

January 30, 2023

### Upgrade Paths {#2-8-0-upgrade-paths}

NGINX Instance Manager 2.8.0 supports upgrades from these previous versions:

- 2.5.0 - 2.7.0

If your NGINX Instance Manager version is older, you may need to upgrade to an intermediate version before upgrading to the target version.

### What's New{#2-8-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Enhanced details page for SSL Certificates**

   The Instance Manager web interface now features an improved details page for SSL Certificates. This page provides important information about the certificate and any associated instances.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Automatic retrieval of Attack Signatures and Threat Campaign updates to Instance Manager**

   Instance Manager now allows you to [set up automatic downloads of the most recent Attack Signature and Threat Campaign packages]({{< ref "/nim/nginx-app-protect/setup-waf-config-management.md##automatically-download-latest-packages" >}}). By publishing these updates to your App Protect instances from Instance Manager, you can ensure your applications are shielded from all recognized attack types.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Improved WAF Compiler error messages**

   The messaging around [security policy compilation errors]({{< ref "/nim/nginx-app-protect/manage-waf-security-policies.md#check-for-compilation-errors" >}}) has been improved by providing more detailed information and alerting users if the required compiler version is missing.


### Changes in Default Behavior{#2-8-0-changes-in-behavior}
This release has the following changes in default behavior:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Switching between storing secrets on disk and using Vault migrates secrets**

  When transitioning between storing secrets on disk or using HashiCorp Vault, any existing secrets can be easily migrated to the new storage method. For instructions, refer to the guide [Configure Vault for Storing Secrets]({{< ref "/nim/system-configuration/configure-vault.md" >}}).

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Create roles using either an object name or UID**

  You can now use either an object name or a unique identifier (UID) when assigning object-level permissions while creating or editing a role via the Instance Manager REST API.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Upgrading from 2.7 or earlier, you must re-enable `precompiled_publication` to continue publishing security policies with Instance Manager**

  To continue publishing security policies with Instance Manager if you are upgrading from Instance Manager 2.7 and earlier, you must set the  `precompiled_publication` parameter to `true` in the `nginx-agent.conf` file.

  In Instance Manager 2.7 and earlier, the `pre-compiled_publication` setting was set to `true` by default. However, starting with Instance Manager 2.8, this setting is set to `false` by default. This means you will need to change this setting to `true` again when upgrading from earlier versions.

  To publish App Protect policies from Instance Manager, add the following to your `nginx-agent.conf` file:

  ```yaml
      nginx_app_protect:
         precompiled_publication: true
  ```

  Among the benefits of deploying from a helm chart, the chart includes the required services, which you can scale independently as needed; upgrades can be done with a single helm command; and there's no requirement for root privileges.

  For instructions, see [Install from a Helm Chart]({{< ref "/nim/deploy/kubernetes/deploy-using-helm.md" >}}).


### Changes in Default Behavior{#2-1-0-changes-in-behavior}
This release has the following changes in default behavior:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Tags are no longer enforced for RBAC or set when creating or updating a role**

  If you're using tags for RBAC on an earlier version of Instance Manager, you'll need to re-create your roles after upgrading. Tags assigned to instances for the purpose of RBAC won't be honored after you upgrade.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **The DeploymentDetails API now requires values for `failure` and `success`**

  The DeploymentDetails API spec has changed. Now, the `failure` and `success` fields are required. The values can be an empty array or an array of UUIDs of NGINX instances.

  Endpoint: `/systems/instances/deployments/{deploymentUid}`

## 2.0.0

December 21, 2021


### What's New{#2-0-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **(Experimental) Share a configuration across multiple instances**

   With a feature called **Instance Groups**, you can share the same configuration across multiple instances. So, if your website requires a number of instances to support the load, you can publish the same configuration to each instance with ease.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **More metrics and instance dashboards**

   Instance Manager now collects additional metrics from the NGINX instances. We also added pre-configured dashboards to the web interface for each NGINX instance managed by Instance Manager. See the [Catalog Reference]({{< ref "/nms/reference/catalogs/_index.md" >}}) documentation for a complete list of metrics.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **New architecture!**

   We redesigned and improved the architecture of Instance Manager!

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Improved user access control**

   Instance Manager 2.x. allows you to create user access controls with tags. Administrators can grant users read or write access to perform instance management tasks. And admins can grant or restrict access to the Settings options, such as managing licenses and creating users and roles. See the [Set up Authentication]({{< ref "/nim/admin-guide/authentication/basic-auth/set-up-basic-authentication.md#rbac" >}}) guide for more details.
