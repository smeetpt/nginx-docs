This page has been updated to point to the unified NGINX glossary.

For definitions of NGINX-related terms, please refer to the [NGINX Glossary](/nginx-one/glossary/).

For Kubernetes-specific terms such as [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) and [Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/), see the official Kubernetes documentation.
